## Thoughts 
The creation of this project was neither too hard or easy. There are plenty of documentation of the different libraries used.
First decision was to either use ReactJs or Angular, I went with Angular for its TypeScript language.
There are different libraries to choose from when you need a specific type of plugin and to narrow down my choice I always start with reading about the libraries and get a better understanding of which one to choose for my work.
I've learned from working with this project and feel free to test it and share your thoughts.
